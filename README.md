# Clippsly Dock
Clippsly Dock is a set of hover and click animations for buttons in a dock interface. These animations are designed to give your user interface a sleek and polished look, while also providing visual feedback for user interactions.

## Hover Animations
The hover animations in Clippsly Dock are designed to magnify the size of buttons when the user hovers their mouse over them. This gives users a visual indication that the button is interactive and encourages them to click on it.

## Click Animations
The click animations in Clippsly Dock are designed to give buttons a sense of weight and physicality when the user clicks on them. Buttons will jump up slightly and then settle back down, giving the user visual feedback that their click has been registered.

## Usage
To use Clippsly Dock, simply copy the Lua scripts provided in this repository into your project. You can customize the magnification scale, duration, and other properties of the animations by editing the scripts.
